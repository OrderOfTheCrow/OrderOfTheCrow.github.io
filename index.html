        <p>
            <b>What is OOTC?

            Order of the Crow is the first and only student branch of the <a href="https://seti.wp.st-andrews.ac.uk/">SETI Post-Detection Hub</a> </b> (which is based in St
            Andrews). The Hub is affiliated with the <a href="https://www.seti.org/">SETI Institute</a>, a former NASA project, which leads the Search for
            Extraterrestrial Intelligence. We were founded by Dr John Elliott, the head of the <a href="https://www.seti.ac.uk/">UK SETI Research Network</a>
            and a professor at St Andrews.

            Along with our connections to the Hub, OOTC is jointly hosted by the <a href="http://exoplanets.wp.st-andrews.ac.uk" data-type="URL" data-id="exoplanets.wp.st-andrews.ac.uk">St&nbsp;Andrews Centre for Exoplanet Science</a>,
            the <a href="http://cglg.wp.st-andrews.ac.uk" data-type="URL" data-id="cglg.wp.st-andrews.ac.uk">Centre for Global Law and Governance</a>, the <a href="https://www.durham.ac.uk/departments/academic/law/">Durham Law School</a>,
            and the <a href="https://www.jodrellbank.manchester.ac.uk/">Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics</a> of the University of Manchester. Whether you are interested in astrophysics, law, international relations, literature, or astrobiology,
            we have space for your ideas and contributions!</p>

        <p>What do we do?
            Of course, SETI is not only about searching for life beyond Earth. OOTC ponders the political, environmental, ethical, and scientific questions of space exploration.
            Our society provides opportunities for students to get involved with the Hub by publishing their research, writing, podcasts, facilitating networking, and organizing events. 
            Last semester we held pub socials, an introductory event, and set up our research and journalism teams.

            Join us for opportunities in research, writing, podcasts, and networking with SETI experts! OOTC helps establish connections between students and <a href="https://seti.wp.st-andrews.ac.uk/researchers/">SETI experts at St Andrews</a> and <a href="https://www.seti.org/our-scientists">beyond</a>. 
            Students can then research a topic relating to SETI with our Head of Research and their research supervisor. Similarly, we offer opportunities for students to publish their research or 
            writing on topics such as science fiction, films, astrophysics, international relations, space law, etc. This work will be edited by our team and published through our networks and partners!
